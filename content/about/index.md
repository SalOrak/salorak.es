Hi there! I'm **Hector Alarcon**, a software security engineer focused on building internal tooling, research and development as well as systems engineering. During my 4+ years of experience as an engineer I fell in love with the concept of systems. What do I mean by systems? 

From [Oxford Dictionary](https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/) a **system** is:
> A set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network; a complex whole.
{% end %}

To me, understanding how computers work is essentially understanding what parts take place, why are they necessary, what is their sole definition and how they interconnect with all the other parts. This is why **I love Linux**. Linux gives you the freedom to explore each module at your own pace.

In the internet I go by the name of **SalOrak**. And the logo representing me ~the most~ is the one on the right side. 

As a computer engineer I explored many territories, some wilder than other. What I discovered during this adventure is that I love to grease the wheels, to find annoying connections and smoothen them. The good thing is I have been in many perspectives along the way: as a Cybersecurity Analyst, Software Security Researcher, Fullstack Web-developer and even Teacher!. But above all, I'm an explorer. And that is something I hope is visible in my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/SalOrak)
