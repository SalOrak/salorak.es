# Hello!

Hello there! If you are reading this its because the website and the `blog` section is opened.

I've been a passionate developer for a couple years now, and I have some opinions and thoughts about how the technology works.

I've worked in many workplaces, probably too many, but hey! I've discovered a ton of ways to work, to make things work, to build, to manage, to communicate and to team up. 

I do am specially excited for this section, as it is the foundation for my voice in the internet.


With everything, thank you for passing by and I hope to see you around!
