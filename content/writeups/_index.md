I like hacking stuff and smarter people have created platforms to help other people hack stuff. So, here I'll post the list of the public writeups for retired or public machines. These *machines* are mostly from [HacktheBox](https://hackthebox.com), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) or [VulnHub](https://vulnhub.com). Either way, each writeup would have a link to the machine.
