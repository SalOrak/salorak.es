**The art of programming** is the name I decided to give to my experiment where I try to become a Programmer Artist.

### Programmer Artist
What do I mean by *Programmer Artist?* 
A *Programmer Artist* is someone with the necessary skills to beatifully develop software independent of the programming language.

This is heavily inspired by a frequent [tsoding](twitch.tv/tsoding) quote where he says something along the lines of: 
> (..) Do not learn a programming language, instead learn to program. And the only way to learn programming is by learning multiple programming languages, understanding the features each has whilst creating a mental cross-reference guide. This way learning a new programming language is limited to getting to know the syntax, which can be learnt in a week or two. Learn by doing

My path to become a software developer started 10 years ago, but it is now when I have decided to follow a path consciously.


This is my path to become a *Programmer Artist* as well as my attempt to share it publicly.

### What to expect

*So why should you expect to have this section?*
Well, expect to see cheatsheets, tricks, tips, advices and concepts of different programming languages I plan to tackle as well as some systems related concepts.


### The road

Here is the road:
