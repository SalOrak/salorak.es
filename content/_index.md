# Welcome ðŸŒŠ

Hello there and welcome to my humble personal website.  You will be wondering, *what am I going to find in here?*. Well then, you are ~probably~ going to find blog posts about anything I've been working on, I've worked in the past or I'm thinking about it, but mainly `technical`.  Also, you'll find the projects I've developed or contributed to in the Open Source community. 

Finally, you will get to know a little bit about me.

## But where can I find all of those things?

First of all, if you want to search by content you can use the icon ![](icons/search.svg) on the top left of the navigation bar.
Also you can use the handy shortcut `Control + k` to open the search popup directly!

And of course, you can use the following links:
{{ nav_toc() }}



## Contact

Hey! If you want to contact me you can do so by sending me an email at [hello@salorak.es](mailto:hello@salorak.es)
