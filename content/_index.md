Hello! And welcome to my personal website [Salorak.es](https://salorak.es).

I'm Hector, aka *Salorak*, an IT working professional who loves automation, programming, hacking and low level stuff. Over the years I've been building a passion, and a wide spectrum of tech skills, around the concept of *how to efficiently use computers*. And I must admit, there are a whole lot of concepts, skills, technologies and brilliant people behind our today's computer systems.

So, what is the purpose of this website you ask. Well, first of all, nice question, and secondly, the purpose of **salorak.es** is to share the things I'm building, studying  or breaking with some ocassionally written down thoughts. 

There are **3** main sections:

{{< columns >}} <!-- begin columns block -->

## Projects

This section is dedicated to show my *open-source* collaboration. I spend most of my leisure time working on side projects. Here is where I list, explain and reference everything I've done and I'm comfortable sharing. Currently, most of my projects are personal configurations and some scripts but there are already some upcoming low-level projects that would be much more interesting ;)

You can go to the projects section clicking [here](projects) or [here](projects), it doesn't matter.

## The art of Programming

I really REALLY enjoy working efficiently and I like knowing the stuff that I directly interact with. It does not matter if I'm doing some sketches in Excalidraw, moving around in the terminal or develop a simple script to fuzzy find specific directories; I want to know what I'm doing.  And if you join the passion for programming and the efficient mindset you get this section. The art of programming is the path to become a Master of Programming, a truly artist.
For more info, check it out [here](art-programming).

## Hacking
Hmmmm, yes. I like challenges and nowadays one of the most satisfying challenges is hacking. Hacking gives anyone who tries it a new perspective, the "Out of the Box" one. This perspective brings new questions in the working place. 
This section is where I'll post *clean* writeups from various websites. Use this arrow [-->](hacking) to go there.
