# Whaler.nvim

`Whaler.nvim` is a neovim plugin that uses the incredible UI and functionality of [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) to allow fast-switching between directories.

On setup you add which directories contain the projects you want to keep an eye on and that's it! 

The plugin is made with customization in mind, so don't forget to check that out too!
