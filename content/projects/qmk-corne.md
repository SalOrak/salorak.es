# QMK Firmware - Corne 

The `qmk_firmware` github repository is a fork of the official [QMK Github](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git). I've build (and soldered) a split keyboard to use as my daily driver. This split keyboard is the famous [Corne Keyboard from Foostan](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) which has a total of 42 keys, 6 of which are thumb keys.

In this repository I also have my custom keymaps based on Dvorak for Alpha keys. Check it out! 

One thing to mention is that I added navigation keys to move my mouse using the keyboard.
