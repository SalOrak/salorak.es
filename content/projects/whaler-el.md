# Whaler.el

`Whaler.el` is a port of the [whaler.nvim](https://github.com/salorak/whaler.nvim.git) neovim plugin to the Emacs ecosystem. 

It is based around the same concept but adding a more customizable API for Emacs users to work with.

**Whaler** offers a tailored experience to managing your projects. It is a minimalistic and highly customizable project manager. 

**Whaler** acts as a `completing-read` function extension to move ~blazingly~ fast between directories as well as have a minimalistic sense of working directory whilst providing an easy to use API to work with directories.

`Whaler.el` is a package to move between directories while maintaining a sense of working directory, i.e a project manager.

Don't forget to check it out, it is available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/whaler).
