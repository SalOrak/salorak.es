# What am I doing right now?

Hey! I've been working on a couple of things all at the same time but it's time to update this page right?

I've developed a plugin for neovim that I really wanted to have, check it out [here](http://github.com/salorak/whaler.nvim.git) aaaaaaand I've been looking into starting a more ambitious project.

I won't spoil anything but the main theme of the project is around `containers` and `eBPF`.
This interest came right after watching almost all conferences of [Liz Rice](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=liz+rice) on YouTube. You should definitely take a look, they are worth your time I promise.



# What about `The art of programming` project ? 

The art of programming is an ambitious project that I'm slowly working on. It takes time to practice, understand and put into words so many concepts and experiences.

Be patient !
