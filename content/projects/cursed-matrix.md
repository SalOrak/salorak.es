# Cursed Matrix
A simple matrix effect written in C using the [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.html) library.

I've been using many guides, packages, plugins, applications, utilities and public forks over the years. This project is a naive attempt to give something out there. It is simple, basic but it kinda does the job.
