A Programmer Artist is someone with the necessary skills to beatifully develop software independent of the programming language.\nThis is heavily inspired by a frequent tsoding quote where he says something along the lines of:\n(..) Do not learn a programming language, instead learn to program. And the only way to learn programming is by learning multiple programming languages, understanding the features each has whilst creating a mental cross-reference guide. This way learning a new programming language is limited to getting to know the syntax, which can be learnt in a week or two. Learn by doing\nMy path to become a software developer started 10 years ago, but it is now when I have decided to follow a path consciously.\nThis is my path to become a Programmer Artist as well as my attempt to share it publicly.\nWhat to expect So why should you expect to have this section? Well, expect to see cheatsheets, tricks, tips, advices and concepts of different programming languages I plan to tackle as well as some systems related concepts.\nThe road Here is the road:\n─ ─ ─ T h e a r t o f p r o g r a m m i n g ─ ┌ │ │ │ ├ │ │ │ ├ │ │ │ ├ ┤ │ │ │ │ │ ├ │ │ │ │ │ │ └ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ C H G A S C ─ a o s y r ┌ ├ ┼ └ s ─ s s o ─ ─ ─ ─ k ┌ ├ ┼ └ e t s S C F S e ─ ─ ─ ─ m e s y o e t l S C F S b m - n n a r l y o e t l s c t c t u ─ n n a r y ─ o a e u c ┌ ├ ┼ └ t c t u ─ ┌ ├ ├ │ ├ ┤ ├ ├ ├ ├ └ n x p r t ─ ─ ─ ─ a e u c ┌ ├ ┼ └ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ c t e u S C F S x p r t ─ ─ ─ ─ P T S M I S F N S e s s r y o e t t e u S C F S r h y e P c i e i p e n n a r s s r y o e t o r n m C h l t g t t c t u e n n a r c e c o e e w n s a e u c t c t u e a h r d s o a ─ x p r t a e u c s d r y u y r l ┌ ┼ └ t e u x p r t s s o ─ l s k s ─ ─ ─ s s r t e u e n ┌ ┼ └ i t i P P D e s s r s i ─ ─ ─ n e n r r i e z C P V g m g o o f a o h i s g g f t n y r r r e i c s t a a r o e i u m m e n p c a m m n t a l i i c s l n n e m g g s m e e m U I m o n n o r i t r y o e y n r s e c t i o n Image source: https://arthursonzogni.com/Diagon/#Tree\nDiagon source file: https://salorak.es/art-programming/tree.diagon\n","description":"The art of programming is the name I decided to give to my experiment where I try to become a Programmer Artist.\nProgrammer Artist What to expect The road Programmer Artist What do I mean by Programmer Artist?

Hello there! This section is dedicated to show my humble open-source collaboration.\nI enjoy working on side projects that either looks fun to do, it is an interesting topic I wanted to explore or just because.\nThe following list are the current public projects I\u0026rsquo;ve done:\ndotfiles: A simple bash script to configure (and link) all my configurations files. It also contains my current configuration files. salorak-configuration-files: A previous version of my dotfiles where I created bash scripts to configure and install any dependencies of each configuration files. It also contains some useful scripts such as a VPN selector to choose between HackTheBox and TryHackMe openvpn files. Feel free to check it out! cursed-matrix: A simple matrix effect written in C using the ncurses library, thus the name. It is not finished but it works relatively well on Linux machines. whaler.nvim: A Neovim telescope extension plugin to move between projects blazingly fast, using the same concepts of the tmux-sesionizer from ThePrimeagen. Check it out! qmk_firmware: A QMK fork to store my own QMK configuration and layout. dotfiles This project takes HEAVY inspiration on tsoding bash script to configure his dotfiles. The script is quite easy as it only loops over a MANIFEST, a file containing a table with the path to dotfiles and the destination path, and configures everything.\nThe main differences with tsoding script are the following:\nI pretty much overengineer\u0026rsquo;d the MANIFEST to make it look more human readable. Added a backup support, where it allows to use the my configuration files and revert the changes at any time. Do not do it with directories! Added arguments to allow versatility. Oh! And it contains my current configuration files. Take a look at it, you will be surprised I joined both worlds: Emacs and Nvim.\nsalorak-config-files My previous configuration git repository. This was my first attempt to unify my configuration files and create a personal installer.\nIt contains a LOT of work over the commits. I did not want to remove it as it contains a part of me.\nOne of the things I did was create a bash script to install each package I had in my machine along with some system utilities (such as xclip). When I realized I did not want to execute 10 scripts manually I created the full_install.sh to chain all the scripts in the correct order. If you want to have my previous setup, just run the script and watch how your Ubuntu (yes, I use Ubuntu) changes its shape completely.\ncursed-matrix A simple matrix effect written in C using the ncurses library.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been using many guides, packages, plugins, applications, utilities and public forks over the years. This project is a naive attempt to give something out there. It is simple, basic but it kinda does the job.\nwhaler.nvim Whaler.nvim is a neovim plugin that uses the incredible UI and functionality of Telescope to allow fast-switching between directories.\nOn setup you add which directories contain the projects you want to keep an eye on and that\u0026rsquo;s it!\nThe plugin is made with customization in mind, so don\u0026rsquo;t forget to check that out too!\nIn case you are looking for the repository, click here to go directly ;)\nqmk_firmware The qmk_firmware github repository is a fork of the official QMK Github. I\u0026rsquo;ve build (and soldered) a split keyboard to use as my daily driver. This split keyboard is the famous Corne Keyboard from Foostan which has a total of 42 keys, 6 of which are thumb keys.\nIn this repository I also have my custom keymaps based on Dvorak for Alpha keys. Check it out!\nOne thing to mention is that I added navigation keys to move my mouse using the keyboard.\n","description":"Welcome to my humble project hub! Hello there!

And welcome to my personal website Salorak.es.\nI\u0026rsquo;m Hector, aka Salorak, an IT working professional who loves automation, programming, hacking and low level stuff. Over the years I\u0026rsquo;ve been building a passion, and a wide spectrum of tech skills, around the concept of how to efficiently use computers. And I must admit, there are a whole lot of concepts, skills, technologies and brilliant people behind our today\u0026rsquo;s computer systems.\nHector Salorak From my standard CV:\nI define myself as a passionate developer focusing on security and systems programming as a professional who has worked in a wide spectrum of disciplines, seeking to learn and implement each perspective into the workflow. I\u0026rsquo;m a Penetration Tester and a Programmer who enjoys the art that goes into each work. I thrive on establishing best practices and automating as much as possible.\nSo, what is the purpose of this website you ask. Well, first of all, nice question, and secondly, the purpose of salorak.es is to share the things I\u0026rsquo;m building, studying or breaking with some ocassionally written down thoughts.\nThere are 3 main sections:\nProjects This section is dedicated to show my open-source collaboration. I spend most of my leisure time working on side projects. Here is where I list, explain and reference everything I\u0026rsquo;ve done and I\u0026rsquo;m comfortable sharing. Currently, most of my projects are personal configurations and some scripts but there are already some upcoming low-level projects that would be much more interesting ;)\nYou can go to the projects section clicking here or here, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\nThe art of Programming I really REALLY enjoy working efficiently and I like knowing the stuff that I directly interact with. It does not matter if I\u0026rsquo;m doing some sketches in Excalidraw, moving around in the terminal or develop a simple script to fuzzy find specific directories; I want to know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. And if you join the passion for programming and the efficient mindset you get this section. The art of programming is the path to become a Master of Programming, a truly artist. For more info, check it out here.\nHacking I like challenges and nowadays one of the most satisfying challenges is hacking. Hacking gives anyone who tries it a new perspective, the \u0026ldquo;Out of the Box\u0026rdquo; one. This perspective brings new questions in the working place. This section is where I\u0026rsquo;ll post clean writeups from various websites. Use this arrow \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; to go there.\nOh! I almost forgot.
