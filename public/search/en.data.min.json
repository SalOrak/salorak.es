A Programmer Artist is someone with the necessary skills to beatifully develop software independent of the programming language.\nThis is heavily inspired by a frequent tsoding quote where he says something along the lines of:\n(..) Do not learn a programming language, instead learn to program. And the only way to learn programming is by learning multiple programming languages, understanding the features each has whilst creating a mental cross-reference guide. This way learning a new programming language is limited to getting to know the syntax, which can be learnt in a week or two. Learn by doing\nMy path to become a software developer started 10 years ago, but it is now when I have decided to follow a path consciously.\nThis is my path to become a Programmer Artist as well as my attempt to share it publicly.\nWhat to expect So why should you expect to have this section? Well, expect to see cheatsheets, tricks, tips, advices and concepts of different programming languages I plan to tackle as well as some systems related concepts.\nThe road Here is the road:\n─ ─ ─ T h e a r t o f p r o g r a m m i n g ─ ┌ │ │ │ ├ │ │ │ ├ │ │ │ ├ ┤ │ │ │ │ │ ├ │ │ │ │ │ │ └ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ C H G A S C ─ a o s y r ┌ ├ ┼ └ s ─ s s o ─ ─ ─ ─ k ┌ ├ ┼ └ e t s S C F S e ─ ─ ─ ─ m e s y o e t l S C F S b m - n n a r l y o e t l s c t c t u ─ n n a r y ─ o a e u c ┌ ├ ┼ └ t c t u ─ ┌ ├ ├ │ ├ ┤ ├ ├ ├ ├ └ n x p r t ─ ─ ─ ─ a e u c ┌ ├ ┼ └ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ c t e u S C F S x p r t ─ ─ ─ ─ P T S M I S F N S e s s r y o e t t e u S C F S r h y e P c i e i p e n n a r s s r y o e t o r n m C h l t g t t c t u e n n a r c e c o e e w n s a e u c t c t u e a h r d s o a ─ x p r t a e u c s d r y u y r l ┌ ┼ └ t e u x p r t s s o ─ l s k s ─ ─ ─ s s r t e u e n ┌ ┼ └ i t i P P D e s s r s i ─ ─ ─ n e n r r i e z C P V g m g o o f a o h i s g g f t n y r r r e i c s t a a r o e i u m m e n p c a m m n t a l i i c s l n n e m g g s m e e m U I m o n n o r i t r y o e y n r s e c t i o n Image source: https://arthursonzogni.com/Diagon/#Tree\nDiagon source file: https://salorak.es/art-programming/tree.diagon\n","description":"The art of programming is the name I decided to give to my experiment where I try to become a Programmer Artist.\nProgrammer Artist What to expect The road Programmer Artist What do I mean by Programmer Artist?

This section is dedicated to show my humble open-source collaboration.\nI enjoy working on side projects that either looks fun to do, it is an interesting topic I wanted to explore or just because.\nThe following list are the current public projects I\u0026rsquo;ve done:\ndotfiles: A simple bash script to configure (and link) all my configurations files. It also contains my current configuration files. salorak-configuration-files: A previous version of my dotfiles where I created bash scripts to configure and install any dependencies of each configuration files. It also contains some useful scripts such as a VPN selector to choose between HackTheBox and TryHackMe openvpn files. Feel free to check it out! cursed-matrix: A simple matrix effect written in C using the ncurses library, thus the name. It is not finished but it works relatively well on Linux machines. dotfiles This project takes HEAVY inspiration on tsoding bash script to configure his dotfiles. The script is quite easy as it only loops over a MANIFEST, a file containing a table with the path to dotfiles and the destination path, and configures everything.\nThe main differences with tsoding script are the following:\nI pretty much overengineer\u0026rsquo;d the MANIFEST to make it look more human readable. Added a backup support, where it allows to use the my configuration files and revert the changes at any time. Do not do it with directories! Added arguments to allow versatility. Oh! And it contains my current configuration files. Take a look at it, you will be surprised I joined both worlds: Emacs and Nvim.\nsalorak-config-files My previous configuration git repository. This was my first attempt to unify my configuration files and create a personal installer.\nIt contains a LOT of work over the commits. I did not want to remove it as it contains a part of me.\nOne of the things I did was create a bash script to install each package I had in my machine along with some system utilities (such as xclip). When I realized I did not want to execute 10 scripts manually I created the full_install.sh to chain all the scripts in the correct order. If you want to have my previous setup, just run the script and watch how your Ubuntu (yes, I use Ubuntu) changes its shape completely.\ncursed-matrix A simple matrix effect written in C using the ncurses library.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been using many guides, packages, plugins, applications, utilities and public forks over the years. This project is a naive attempt to give something out there. It is simple, basic but it kinda does the job.\n","description":"Welcome to my humble project hub! Hello there!
